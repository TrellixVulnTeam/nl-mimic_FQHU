    "# Markov chains use example\n",
    "Max Fierro 02/20/2022\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation:\n",
    "This is my first exercise working with both a jupyter notebook and the concept of a Markov chain. The idea is one I was briefly exposed to as a sidenote in one of my classes, CS61a at UC Berkeley in Fall '21. I think I remember one of my instructors, Pamela Fox, briefly going into a tangent of how you could sort of emulate what someone could say by making a 'dictionary' of words from a text, in such a way that every `key:value` pair is every `word:nextword`. It's pretty simple, and it has the somewhat cool property that obtaining `dict[word]` would (if computers were not so annoyingly deterministic) fetch some `nextword`, where the probability of choosing it depends on the amount of times it appears after `word` divided by the total number of appearances of `word` in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contents:\n",
    "This also being my first 'real' practical experience working with data, I thought I should be as verbose as possible. While I know this is obviously not the most elegant way of doing this, the code is pretty easy to understand and allows for seeing what is happening at every step of the (albeit very short) way, in case you are into that (TBH I also needed a tiny refresher with Python). BTW, I do not endorse the language used in 'Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' by Mark Twain, in case you are either pseudo-stochastically or deterministically presented a no-no word.\n",
    "\n",
    "   So! Here is what is in this notebook:\n",
    "1. A `PairLink` class defining `word:nextword` pairs."

    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "While this served its purpose as a first exercise, it obviously constitutes a very poor model when it comes to prediction. It also has a lot of unnecessary stuff which I made for the sake of killing time and remembering some details about Python, which probably make it very unefficient. I think I will try to make another version which is both more eficient and coded more concisely after reading a bit about Markov chains (note how all I know about them right now is the 3-sentence overview graciously provided by Pamela about a semester ago) including their mathematical representation and properties, which I decided to omit considering the apparent simplicity of the task at hand. But you can never really know too much math, can you?"
